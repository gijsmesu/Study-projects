# Study-projects
 In this repositrory I upload all codes I have made (some alone, some in collaboration with other students) for projects while studying at Tilburg University.
 Codes within this repositrory contain codes from both study programs I follow(ed). The bachelors degree I obtained (Communication and Information Sciences, specialized in New Media Design (with distinction)) and the masters degree Data Science and Society, which I also obtained (cum laude).
This way several people, including myself can keep track of my coding skills and developments in this area.

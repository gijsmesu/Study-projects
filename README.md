# Study-projects
 In this repositrory I upload all codes I have made (some alone, some in collaboration with other students) for projects while studying at Tilburg University.
 Codes within this repositrory contain codes from both study programs I follow(ed). The bachelors degree I obtained (Communication and Information Sciences, specialized in New Media Design) and the masters program Data Science and Society, which I currently attend.
 This way several people, including myself can keep track of my coding skills and developments in this area.
